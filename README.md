# Disclaimer
I used ChatGPT to generate the QR Code generation and added the text addition according to the top answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16373425/add-text-on-image-using-pil

# Background
Tools will be run once a year to share the Drachenfest Tickets I buy in bulk (cheapest early bird price) with my friends. (bulk size ~20 tickets)
human readable code is needed for registration, qr code is required to get access at eventlocation. (qr on smartphone is tested and DF approved!)

# Usage
A simple CSV where the first column has the names and the 2nd colum the code.
Name it 'data.csv'
The images will be saved in the execution path.
